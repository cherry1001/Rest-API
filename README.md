Background

AdelaideX in conjunction with the Humanities Faculty are developing a Shakespeare MOOC for release at the end of 2017. 

It has been discussed with the course team that a good resource for the students of this course would be some key content and data about Shakespeare’s works. 

A general example of end user (student) interaction could be. Aweb page with a drop down menu that would display the 3 types of plays Shakespeare created:  Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies. The student then could then select ‘comedies’and a list of comedies isdisplayed, if the student then clickson the play then the Scenes and Characters are listed.There are some general stats displayed for example the number of lines next to each character and links to the scenes.

Application description

The aim of this project would be to make a read-only REST API of the underlying database model. 

The application would be built using Python Django framework (https://www.djangoproject.com/) to reverse engineer the MySQL database model. The Django framework provides a REST serialization framework that can use the reverse engineered ORM as a data source (http://www.django-rest-framework.org/). Once the basic views were developed and tested it would then be possible to provide more detailed functional requirements on the viewsand schema relationships.
